Projects created using `djereo` include:

- A basic Python package and entrypoint, configured via a `pyproject.toml`.
- Dependencies managed via `uv`, using a `uv.lock` file for reproducible builds.
- IPython as the default shell.
- Simple configuration to enhance your logs with `structlog`.
- Ready-to-use dev tools: Django Debug Toolbar, `django-browser-reload`, runserver logs
  formatted using `rich`.
- Out-of-the-box code coverage reporting with `coverage.py`.
- Batteries-included `pre-commit` hook configuration to lint & format code, and run SAST.
- A `justfile` to enable using `just` as a task runner.

Optionally, for projects intended to be hosted on GitHub, also include:

- GitHub Actions to:
  - Automate cutting releases via `Release Please`.
  - Run `pre-commit` hooks and `pytest` as part of a Continuous Integration pipeline.
- A `dependabot` configuration to keep Python packages & GitHub Actions up to date.

> Starting a Python project? Try [pycliche](https://github.com/albertomh/pycliche), the base
> djereo is built on, as your Python project template.

## Prerequisites

To use `djereo` the following must be available locally:

- [Python 3.10](https://docs.python.org/3.10/) or above
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

## Bootstrap a new Django project

Bootstrap a new Django project using `djereo`:

1. Navigate to the directory under which you wish to create a new project.
1. Run `uvx copier copy --trust gh:albertomh/djereo <project_name>` and follow the wizard.

This creates a directory under your current location. Follow the README in the new directory
to get started with your project.

Please note:

- it is not necessary to clone `djereo`. The `gh:albertomh/djereo` argument will pull
  the latest tag from GitHub.
- the `--trust` flag is necessary since a post-creation task initialises the new directory
  as a git repository and generates a `uv` lockfile.

## Update existing projects

To update a project created using an older version of `djereo` to a newer version of the
template:

```sh
cd ~/Projects/existing_project/
uvx copier update --skip-answered --trust [--vcs-ref=<TAG>]
```

If the `--vcs-ref` flag is not specified `copier` will use the latest `djereo` tag.
