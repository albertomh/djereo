## Features

Projects created using `djereo` include:

- A Django web application, configured via a `pyproject.toml`.
- Dependencies managed via `uv`, using a `uv.lock` file for reproducible builds.
- An implementation of the 'custom User + UserProfile' pattern, tied together with a
  `django-allauth` integration.
- Optional vendorised `htmx` with sensible defaults for the frontend.
- Simple configuration to enhance your logs with `structlog`.
- Ready-to-use dev tools: Django Debug Toolbar, `django-browser-reload`, runserver logs
  formatted using `rich`, `structlog` in production.
- IPython as the default shell.
- Out-of-the-box code coverage reporting with `coverage.py`.
- `pre-commit` hooks to lint & format code, and run SAST.
- A `justfile` to use `just` as a task runner for common jobs.
- Lean containerisation to quickly deploy a project to hosted environments.
- Settings to score A+ on securityheaders.com, for peace of mind.
- ...and more!

Optionally, for projects intended to be hosted on GitHub, also include:

- GitHub Actions to:
  - Automate cutting releases via `Release Please`.
  - Run `pre-commit` hooks and `pytest` as part of a Continuous Integration pipeline.
- A `dependabot` configuration to keep Python packages & GitHub Actions up to date.

## Quickstart

This section covers how to create a Django project using `djereo` as a template.

### Prerequisites

The following must be available locally:

- [Python 3.12](https://docs.python.org/3.12/) or above
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- [just](https://github.com/casey/just)

### Bootstrap a new Django project

Bootstrap a new Django project using `djereo`:

1. Navigate to the directory under which you wish to create a new project.
1. Run `uvx copier copy --trust gh:albertomh/djereo <project_name>` and follow the wizard.

This creates a directory under your current location. Follow the README in the new
`<project_name>/` directory to get started with your project.

Please note:

- it is not necessary to clone `djereo`. The `gh:albertomh/djereo` argument will pull
  the latest tag from GitHub.
- the `--trust` flag is necessary to allow a post-creation task to initialise the new directory
  as a git repository and generate a `uv` lockfile.
