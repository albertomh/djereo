# {{project_name}}

## Prerequisites

To use `{{project_name}}` the following must be available locally:

- [Python {{python_version}}](https://docs.python.org/{{python_version}}/) or above
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- [just](https://github.com/casey/just)

## Quickstart: run locally

A `justfile` defines common development tasks. Run `just` to show all available recipes.

```sh
# 1/5 create a postgres user and database for your project - change 'password' below
psql -U $(whoami) -d postgres -v APP_USER_PASSWORD='password' -f _db/set_up.sql

# 2/5 update the {password} in the DATABASE_URL connection strings in both .env & .env.test
# The .env file is created for you as a post-creation task.

# 3/5 apply migrations to the database
just manage migrate

# 4/5 create three users: admin, staff and regular (non-privileged)
just manage seed_database

# 5/5 install dependencies in a virtual environment and run the Django development server
just runserver
```

IPython is available as the default shell. Start an interactive session with:

```sh
just shell
```

## Develop

### djereo

`{{project_name}}` has been generated using the [djereo](https://github.com/albertomh/djereo)
project template.

To update `{{project_name}}` to a newer version of `djereo`:

```sh
cd ~/Projects/{{project_name}}/
uvx copier update --skip-answered --trust [--vcs-ref=<TAG>]
```

If the `--vcs-ref` flag is not specified, `copier` will use the latest `djereo` tag.

### Development prerequisites

In addition to the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) above, you will need the following to
develop `{{project_name}}`:

- [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)

### Managing settings

`environs` is used to load values from a `.env` file for use as settings. For safety this
behaviour is disabled during testing, with settings falling back to sensible defaults.
A `.env.in` template file should be used to generate the local `.env` used during development.
`.env` is listed in `.gitignore` as it should never be tracked in verion control.

### Dependency management

Dependencies are defined in the `pyproject.toml` file, with exact versions captured by a
`uv.lock` lockfile. `uv` is used to manage dependencies:

```sh
# add a dependency to the project
uv add some-package
```
{%if is_github_project%}
Dependabot is configured to run weekly and update Python packages (minor & patch) and
GitHub Actions. See [.github/dependabot.yaml](.github/dependabot.yaml).
{%endif%}
### Logging

`{{project_name}}` uses [structlog](https://www.structlog.org/en/stable/) when DEBUG is
False. This configuration is intended for deployed environments such as production. When
DEBUG is True, such as when developing locally, `rich` is used to format logs.
The logging configuration is generated by `logging.LoggingConfigFactory`.

You may issue logs as follows:

```python
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.info("{{project_name}} running", key="value")
```

### Style

Code style is enforced by pre-commit hooks. Linter rules are configured in the `ruff`
tables in `pyproject.toml`.

```sh
# before you start developing, install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```

Docstrings should follow the conventions set out in the [Google styleguide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings).

Please follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
guidelines when writing commit messages. `commitlint` is enabled as a pre-commit hook.
Valid commit types are defined in `.commitlintrc.ts`.

## Test

Django's test runner (using the standard library's `unittest`) is used for the suite of
unit tests. Run all tests and report on code coverage:

```sh
just test [<expression>]

# eg. to only run tests inside the `test_migrations` module
just test tests.test_migrations
```
{%if is_github_project%}
## Release

[Release Please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) is used to automate:

- Updating the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).
- Calculating the new SemVer tag based on conventional commit types.
- Creating a new GitHub release.

Release Please is configured as a GitHub action ([release-please.yaml](.github/workflows/release-please.yaml)).
It keeps a release pull request open that is refreshed as changes are merged into `main`.
To cut a release, simply merge the release pull request.

### GitHub Personal Access Token

In order for Release Please to automate the above process, a GitHub Actions secret called
`RELEASE_PLEASE_TOKEN` must exist in GitHub (under {{project_name}}/settings/secrets/actions).
The contents of this secret must be a Personal Access Token (PAT) with the following permissions:

```text
contents: write
pull-requests: write
```

For more information, consult the [release-please-action project](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please-action).
{%endif%}
## Deploy {{project_name}}

The `_deploy/` directory of includes a Dockerfile that uses the local development toolchain
(the `uv` project manager) to containerise the application.

The Dockerfile runs pre-production steps, such as enabling bytecode compilation to trade a longer
installation time for faster start-up times, or running Django's `collectstatic` command.
The container's entrypoint runs [gunicorn](https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/latest/index.html)
as the WSGI web server to make the Django application available.

Build an deployment-ready image with:

```sh
docker build \
  --file _deploy/deploy.Dockerfile \
  --platform linux/amd64 \
  --tag {{project_name}}:amd64 \
  --load .
```

The recommended use of the resulting container is to use [nginx](https://nginx.org/en/docs/index.html)
as the reverse proxy, with `gunicorn` as the WSGI web server.
