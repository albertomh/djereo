## Features

Projects created using `djereo` include:

- A basic Python package and entrypoint, configured via a `pyproject.toml`.
- Dependencies managed via `uv`, using a `uv.lock` file for reproducible builds.
- IPython as the default shell.
- Simple configuration to enhance your logs with `structlog`.
- Sensible defaults to use a `postgres` database from the start.
- Ready-to-use dev tools: Django Debug Toolbar, `django-browser-reload`, runserver logs
  formatted using `rich`, `structlog` in production.
- Out-of-the-box unit test suite & code coverage reporting.
- Batteries-included `pre-commit` hook configuration to lint & format code, and run SAST.
- A `justfile` to use `just` as a task runner for common jobs.
- Lean containerisation to quickly deploy a project to hosted environments.
- ...and more!

Optionally, for projects intended to be hosted on GitHub, also include:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD007 ul-indent -->
- GitHub Actions to:
    - Automate cutting releases via `Release Please`.
    - Run `pre-commit` hooks and `pytest` as part of a Continuous Integration pipeline.
- A `dependabot` configuration to keep Python packages & GitHub Actions up to date.
