Projects created using `djereo` include:

- A basic Python package and entrypoint, configured via a `pyproject.toml`.
- Dependencies managed via `uv`, using a `uv.lock` file for reproducible builds.
- IPython as the default shell.
- Simple configuration to enhance your logs with `structlog`.
- Ready-to-use dev tools: Django Debug Toolbar, `django-browser-reload`, runserver logs
  formatted using `rich`.
- Out-of-the-box code coverage reporting with `coverage.py`.
- Batteries-included `pre-commit` hook configuration to lint & format code, and run SAST.
- A `justfile` to enable using `just` as a task runner.
- ...and more!

Optionally, for projects intended to be hosted on GitHub, also include:

- GitHub Actions to:
  - Automate cutting releases via `Release Please`.
  - Run `pre-commit` hooks and `pytest` as part of a Continuous Integration pipeline.
- A `dependabot` configuration to keep Python packages & GitHub Actions up to date.
