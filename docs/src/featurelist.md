# Djereo's features

`djereo` is a Django project template with opinionated tooling.

When invoked by following the instructions in the [Quickstart](./quickstart.md) the user
is prompted to answer questions and make choices via a CLI. These answers are used to
create a ready-to-use opinionated Django project.

This page documents the features of a Django project as generated by `djereo`.

[copier.yaml](https://github.com/albertomh/djereo/blob/main/copier.yaml){target=\"_blank"}
defines the questionnaire that `copier` will use to prompt the user when setting up a new
project. The questions defined in this file include sensible defaults (where appropriate)
and validation rules to prevent incoherent answers.

### Versions

Users are asked three version-related questions when initialising a project:

#### Django version

[Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/){target=\"_blank"} is a popular web
framework written in Python. `djereo` gives you the choice between creating projects using
Django versions:

- 5.1 (latest)
- 4.2 (LTS, long-term support version)

See [https://endoflife.date/django](https://endoflife.date/django){target=\"_blank"} for
more information.

#### Python version

`djereo` (and its base, [pycliche](https://github.com/albertomh/pycliche){target=\"_blank"})
support Python 3.10 and above. The user's choice is recorded in a [.python-version](https://github.com/albertomh/djereo/blob/main/template/.python-version.jinja){target=\"_blank"}
file and in the `requires-python` field of [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/albertomh/djereo/blob/main/template/pyproject.toml.jinja){target=\"_blank"}.

See [https://endoflife.date/python](https://endoflife.date/python){target=\"_blank"} for
more information.

#### Semantic Versioning

The generated project follows Semantic Versioning, with users prompted to provide an
initial version at project setup. The project's version is tracked in the `version` field
of [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/albertomh/djereo/blob/main/template/pyproject.toml.jinja){target=\"_blank"}.

See Release Please below for information on how this version can be used alongside
Conventional Commits to automatically generate changelogs and new semver tags.

See [https://semver.org/](https://semver.org/){target=\"_blank"} for more information.

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 line-length -->

Every new project comes with a set of sensible [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/){target=\"_blank"}
git hooks. These are defined in [.pre-commit-config.yaml](https://github.com/albertomh/djereo/blob/main/template/.pre-commit-config.yaml.jinja){target=\"_blank"}
and include:

- Common core hooks such as `check-merge-conflict` or `end-of-file-fixer`.
- `mypy` to perform static type checks on Python code.
- `asottile/pyupgrade` to convert syntax when the version of Python is upgraded.
- `astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit` to lint & format Python code at lightspeed with Ruff.
- `DavidAnson/markdownlint-cli2` to lint markdown files with rules configured in [.markdownlint-cli2.yaml](https://github.com/albertomh/djereo/blob/main/template/.markdownlint-cli2.yaml){target=\"_blank"}.
- `biomejs/pre-commit` to lint & format frontend code (JS, TS, CSS) following config in [biome.jsonc](https://github.com/albertomh/djereo/blob/main/template/biome.jsonc){target=\"_blank"}.
- `adamchainz/djade-pre-commit` to format Django templates.
- `adamchainz/django-upgrade` to automatically migrate code to a new version of Django.
- `alessandrojcm/commitlint-pre-commit-hook` to enforce [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/){target=\"_blank"}.
